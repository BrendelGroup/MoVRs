# MoVRs
__Motif set Reduction and Validation (MoVRs) - a workflow for the derivation of genome-wide DNA motif detection and vetting__

The MoVRs repository encompasses scripts we developed in the [Brendel Group](http://brendelgroup.org/) as an extension to widely used software for DNA motif finding in the pursuit of statistically sound and biologically meaningful predictions.

## Getting Started

The __MoVRs__ package conforms to our [RAMOSE](https://github.com/BrendelGroup/)
philosophy and promise: we made every attempt to make the software such that
you can produce __reproducible__, __accurate__, and __meaningful__ results; our
software is __open__ (source), designed to be __scalable__, and __easy__ to use
(so that a typical genome laboratory should be able to run it).  And, of course,
our software should be _ramose_ ("having many branches") - it's yours to use,
modify, improve, enhance, ... .

To proceed, please follow the instructions in the [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md)
document.  Once all preparatory steps are taken care of, see the
[HOWTO](./HOWTO.md) document
