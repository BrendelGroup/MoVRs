#Some of the examples require pre-installed HOMER genome data.
#
#You can see what has been installed system-wide using the following command
# (look for a + symbol in the first column):
#
perl /usr/local/src/HOMER/configureHomer.pl -list

#If you need to make the hg19 data sets available, do so as follows:
#
sudo perl /usr/local/src/HOMER/configureHomer.pl -install hg19
sudo perl chmod -R a+w /usr/local/src/HOMER/data
sudo perl /usr/local/src/HOMER/configureHomer.pl -install human-p
