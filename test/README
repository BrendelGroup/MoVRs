VB Notes August 10:

Some examples, just to test program options and flow.
You should read the xtest* scripts before executing, and they are meant in part
to be run in sequence.
Documentation will be need to be provided.
The examples assume at least 10 CPUs are available.  If not, adjust the -p argument.

Also, there are still loose ends in the MoVRs script, including
 - reading of the *.conf file
 - error handling
 - message content
 - description that numproc should ideally be a multiple of kfold

Not added to the scripts directory is a check configuration script to test
for requisite programs and packages (prototype in preparation).

Also we need to describe ananconda and then creating a python environment
with conda.
Output documentation is still missing, as well as the finding of our motifs in
the validation sets as last step of MoVRs.
