#This example requires that hg19 has been install for HOMER; something equivalent to the following
#should have been run first:
#
#	sudo perl /usr/local/src/HOMER/configureHomer.pl -install hg19
#	sudo perl chmod -R a+w /usr/local/src/HOMER/data
#
#Alternatively, you may have run xpretest beforehand ...
